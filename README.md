# SteamDepotDownloaderGUI for steam-deck

**This branch houses the Steam Deck-compatible version of SteamDepotDownloaderGUI**  
Code is pretty messy, but it (should) work.

<hr>

1. To use, download the build from [**Here**]()
and run it.  
2. Now open the file and click on the gear icon.
3. Click "Auto Download .NET" and wait for it to finish.
4. Should be good to go!
**If any issues arise, please join the [support Discord](discord.com/invite/3qCt4DT5qe) and ask there. **
